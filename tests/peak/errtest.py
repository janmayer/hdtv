# Program to test handling of spectra with explicit errors in hdtv
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Spectra that are directly recorded usually have errors \sqrt{n} for each bin,
# where n is the number of counts in the bin. However, after scaling, this is
# no longer true. Thus, scaled spectra need to specify the bin errors
# explicitly.
# This program can be used to test the handling of spectra with explicit
# errors in hdtv.
