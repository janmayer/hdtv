HDTV is a nuclear spectrum and coincidence matrix analysis tool.
It can load uncompressed (text), compressed, and ROOT spectra and 2D-matrices.
It calibrates spectra, fits peaks with background with different models, and cuts matrices.
HDTV is written in a mixture of C++ and Python, glued together using PyROOT.


## Installation

HDTV requires [CERN ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) with working Python bindings.
ROOT **6.22.00** and **6.22.02** are [**not compatible**](https://root.cern.ch/doc/v622/release-notes.html#language-bindings) with HDTV, but ROOT 6.22.04 and higher is.

```sh
pip install hdtv
```

Please note that the python package (wheel) does currently not include the compiled libraries required to run, as these depend on the root version, the python version, the compiler, and the moon phases.
Instead, these are compiled automatically at first start, which requires certain build tools (see below).

Alternatively, the compilation can be triggered with
```sh
hdtv --rebuild-usr
```
for the current user; or with
```sh
hdtv --rebuild-sys
```
for all user (requires superuser privileges).


### Requirements
To build and run HDTV, the following dependencies are required:

* Python
	- Tested with 3.6, 3.7, 3.8
	- Packages: numpy scipy matplotlib prompt_toolkit uncertainties traitlets
    - Packages for development & testing: docutils pytest pytest-cov
* [Cern ROOT](https://root.cern/) 6 (version 6.16.00 or higher, **except** 6.22.00 and 6.22.02)
    - Needs to be compiled against the correct python version.
    - In python, **`import ROOT` must succeed.**
    - System packages may be available on some systems, e.g. `<tool> install root python3-root`
* cmake, gcc, g++ (or similar, in a somewhat modern version)
* libx11-dev `<tool> install libx11-6 libx11-dev`

### Usage with docker

just execute
```sh
docker build --tag hdtv . && docker run -ti -p 8080:8080 hdtv
```
then no further installation is required and you will be able to use HDTV with a Jupyter notebook server.

A usage without notebook server - with X forwarding - is also possible. For that case execute
```
docker build --tag hdtv . && docker run -e DISPLAY=${DISPLAY} -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --rm -it --user $(id -u) hdtv hdtv
```

## Documentation
For more information, including an overview of the available key
bindings, refer to the [documentation](doc/guide/hdtv.rst).
A [tutorial](doc/guide/hdtv-tutorial.rst) giving an introduction
to HDTV and its basic features is also available.


## Further installation topics

### Run locally from source directory without installation

```
git clone https://github.com/janmayer/hdtv.git
cd hdtv
./bin/hdtv
```

Generate man pages:

```
cd doc/guide
make doc
```


### Handling different ROOT versions

HDTV uses `ROOT.gSystem.Load(libary)` to load some critical
components. These need to be compiled against the *exact* ROOT
version imported in python. HDTV will try to automatically recompile
the libraries for the current ROOT if the available ones cannot
be loaded. This can also be forced with:

`hdtv --rebuild-usr`

When installed system-wide, the libraries can be recompiled once for
all users with:

`hdtv --rebuild-sys`

This eliminates the need to reinstall HDTV after changes to the root
installation.

Multiple Versions of ROOT can be used alongside, the correct library
version will be chosen automatically.
