    Resolve the relative path path with respect to the current directory
    specified by cur_posix_path and cur_root_dir.

    cur_posix_path is a string specifying the current working directory. If
    cur_root_dir is not None, it is taken as a TDirectoryFile object specifying
    the working directory inside the ROOT file. The ROOT file is expected to
    reside inside the directory specified by cur_posix_path.

    Returns a triple (new_posix_path, new_root_file, new_root_dir).
    new_posix_path is the new posix path.
    new_root_file is the ROOT file in wich new_root_dir resides, or None if
    new_root_dir resides in the same file as cur_root_dir. If new_root_file is
    not None, the caller is expected to close the file after being done with it.
    (Note: a path moving out of a ROOT file and then back in
    is considered to refer to a different file, with the consequences mentioned
    above.)
    new_root_dir is the new ROOT TDirectory.

    If path is invalid, (None, None, None) is returned.
